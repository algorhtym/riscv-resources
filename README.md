RISC-V Resources
================

A community-driven compilation of RISC-V resources and learning material. The list is dynamically
updated by the community and categorized based on different contexts of the RISC-V scope, taking
also into account different levels of experience/knowledge, allowing anyone interested in RISC-V to
discover RISC-V resources and relevant content (courses, software, documentation, articles etc.) in
an organized fashion.
Feel free to navigate through the resources listed below with their descriptions.

**RISC-V** is an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) based on established Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) principles.

### Learning Pathways for RISC-V

<a id="beginner"></a>

#### Beginner 

For those with little or no knowledge of digital logic design. After studying the **Digital Design** book in this section, you could take the **RVfpga** course in the Intermediate section if you wish as it expands on concepts discussed in the book.

| Resource  |  Author(s) | Description  | Access |

|---|---|---|---|
| **Computer Organization and Design RISC-V edition: The Hardware Software Interface (2nd edition)** | David A. Patterson, John L. Hennesy | Covers the RISC-V Instruction Set in general and does an in-depth examination of the core RISC-V instructions. It also does a deep dive into RISC-V processor implementations. Each chapter includes real-world applications by tying concepts discussed with available modern computers. The book also highlights the interactions between hardware and software by continuously optimizing a sample software program based on the new hardware concepts introduced in each chapter. | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-RISC-V-Architecture/dp/0128203315" target="_blank">[Amazon book link]</a>|
| **Computer Architecture with an Industrial RISC-V Core [RVfpga]** | Sarah Harris, Daniel Chaver-Martinez | This free EdX course expands on topics covered in **Digital Design and Computer Architecture, RISC-V edition** with hands-on learning. This course shows how to target a commercial RISC-V Core and RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) to FPGA, program the RISC-V SoC, and add more functionalities to the RISC-V SoC | <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming/the-linux-foundation-computer-architecture-with-an-industrial-risc-v-core" target="_blank">[Edx course link]</a>|

|---|---|---|---|
| **Design of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture** |Andrew Waterman|Andrew Watermanâ€™s Doctorate of Philosophy dissertation in the University of California, Berkeley, about the RISC-V ISA. It covers how RISC-V is a well structured small base ISA with a variety of optional extensions, making RISC-V convenient for a range of purposes from research and education, low-power embedded devices, to more general-purpose, high-performance computing, with the existence of these optional extensions. It provides a comparison of RISC-V to other popular ISAs as well.| <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2016/EECS-2016-1.pdf" target="_blank">[pdf]</a>|
